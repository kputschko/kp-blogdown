<p>This week I’ll be exploring the names of pets registered in Seattle, WA. The data comes from the <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-03-26">TidyTuesday</a> weekly blog.</p>
<p>We see there are 7 columns and 52,519 rows, with columns relating to data, name, species, breed, and zip code.</p>
<p>The first thing I notice is that the date is provided in character format. Let’s convert that to a date format instead.</p>
<p>Now let’s take a look at a summary table.</p>
<p>Alright! We see the dates range from 2003 to 2018, and that there are some missing values for secondary breed, name and zip code.</p>
<p>With this in mind, let’s take a look at 1) Name Popularity, and 2) Species Popularity by Zip Code.</p>
</div>
<div id="name-popularity" class="section level2">
<h2>Name Popularity</h2>
<p>First of all, let’s calculate the date. Once that’s done we see that the distirbution of names by date is heavily skewed to recent years. This will adjust our plans.</p>
<p>So, let’s just dig into the top names!</p>
<p>We can see there are a handful of names that are used for both cats and dogs. Interestingly, only cats have records without any given names. I imagine this is due to catch and release programs that might exist in the Seattle area.</p>
</div>
<div id="species-by-region" class="section level2">
<h2>Species by Region</h2>
<p>Now let’s look at species by region. I see that there are some registered pigs and goats, let’s see where those are coming from while we’re at it.</p>
<p>This is actually my first time using leaflet, and only one of a handful of times that I’ve worked with data viz and maps. Let’s see how it goes!</p>
<p>This was much more challenging than expected.</p>
</div>
<div id="conclusion" class="section level2">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>What have I learned? Maps are much more challenging to work with than I thought they would be. I hit my three hour limit while trying to figure out how to use leaflet, but it was good practice. Next time I’ll try to add a legend so we know which color represents which species.</p>
<p>That’s all for now. As always you can find the code on my <a href="https://github.com/kputschko/kp-blogdown/tree/master/content/post">GitHub</a> page.</p>
