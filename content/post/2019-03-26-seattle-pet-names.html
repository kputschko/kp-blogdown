<p>This week I’ll be exploring the names of pets registered in Seattle, WA. The data comes from the <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-03-26">TidyTuesday</a> weekly blog.</p>
<p>We see there are 7 columns and 52,519 rows, with columns relating to data, name, species, breed, and zip code.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data_raw %&gt;% glimpse()</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Observations: 52,519

<p>The first thing I notice is that the date is provided in character format. Let’s convert that to a date format instead.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data_dates &lt;- 
  data_raw %&gt;% 
  mutate(license_issue_date = as.Date(license_issue_date, format = &quot;%B %d %Y&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>Now let’s take a look at a summary table.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data_dates %&gt;% fx_describe() %&gt;% DT::datatable()</code></pre>
<div id="htmlwidget-1" style="width:100%;height:auto;" class="datatables html-widget"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-1">{"x":{"filter":"none","data":[["1","2","3","4","5","6","7"],["license_issue_date","license_number","animals_name","species","primary_breed","secondary_breed","zip_code"],["Date","character","character","character","character","character","character"],["52,519","52,519","52,519","52,519","52,519","52,519","52,519"],["0","0","483","0","0","29,517","397"],["0.0%","0.0%","0.9%","0.0%","0.0%","56.2%","0.8%"],["1,064","52,497","13,929","4","336","260","167"],["2003-04-19",null,null,null,null,null,null],["2018-12-31",null,null,null,null,null,null],["2018-02-15",null,null,null,null,null,null],["229.0163","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA"]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>column_name<\/th>\n      <th>column_type<\/th>\n      <th>n<\/th>\n      <th>n_missing<\/th>\n      <th>pct_missing<\/th>\n      <th>n_distinct<\/th>\n      <th>min<\/th>\n      <th>max<\/th>\n      <th>mean<\/th>\n      <th>sd<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false,"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0}]}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
<p>Alright! We see the dates range from 2003 to 2018, and that there are some missing values for secondary breed, name and zip code.</p>
<p>With this in mind, let’s take a look at 1) Name Popularity, and 2) Species Popularity by Zip Code.</p>
</div>
<div id="name-popularity" class="section level2">
<h2>Name Popularity</h2>
<p>First of all, let’s calculate the date. Once that’s done we see that the distirbution of names by date is heavily skewed to recent years. This will adjust our plans.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data_dates %&gt;% 
  filter(!is.na(animals_name)) %&gt;% 
  mutate(year = year(license_issue_date)) %&gt;% 
  count(year) %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(year), y = n)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  theme_kp() +
  labs(x = &quot;Year&quot;, y = &quot;Count (Log10)&quot;, title = &quot;Records per Year&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019-03-26-seattle-pet-names_files/figure-html/pet_names-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>So, let’s just dig into the top names!</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data_name_plot &lt;- 
  data_dates %&gt;% 
  count(species, animals_name, sort = TRUE) %&gt;% 
  filter(n &gt; 5) %&gt;%
  group_by(species) %&gt;% 
  top_n(10, n) %&gt;%
  replace_na(list(animals_name = &quot;No Recorded Name&quot;)) %&gt;% 
  group_by(animals_name) %&gt;% 
  mutate(total_names = sum(n, na.rm = TRUE),
         p = scales::percent(n / total_names, accuracy = 1),
         label_coord = cumsum(n) - n/2)
  
data_name_plot %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(animals_name, total_names), y = n, fill = species)) +
  geom_col(position = &quot;stack&quot;, color = &quot;black&quot;) +
  geom_text(aes(y = label_coord, label = p), color = &quot;white&quot;, size = 3, family = &quot;sans&quot;) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_kp() +
  labs(x = NULL, y = &quot;Count&quot;, fill = &quot;Species&quot;, title = &quot;Top 10 Names of Cats and Dogs&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019-03-26-seattle-pet-names_files/figure-html/name_plot-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>We can see there are a handful of names that are used for both cats and dogs. Interestingly, only cats have records without any given names. I imagine this is due to catch and release programs that might exist in the Seattle area.</p>
</div>
<div id="species-by-region" class="section level2">
<h2>Species by Region</h2>
<p>Now let’s look at species by region. I see that there are some registered pigs and goats, let’s see where those are coming from while we’re at it.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data_raw %&gt;% 
  count(species, sort = TRUE) %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(x = as_factor(species), y = n)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  scale_y_log10() + 
  theme_kp() + 
  labs(x = &quot;Species&quot;, y = &quot;Count (Log 10)&quot;, title = &quot;Count of Species in Seattle Area&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019-03-26-seattle-pet-names_files/figure-html/species-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>This is actually my first time using leaflet, and only one of a handful of times that I’ve worked with data viz and maps. Let’s see how it goes!</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data(zipcode)

data_species &lt;- 
  data_raw %&gt;% 
  mutate_at(vars(species), as_factor) %&gt;% 
  count(zip_code, species, sort = TRUE) %&gt;%   
  inner_join(zipcode, by = c(&quot;zip_code&quot; = &quot;zip&quot;))

pal &lt;- 
  colorFactor(
    palette = &quot;Dark2&quot;, 
    domain = data_species$species %&gt;% unique())

  addCircleMarkers(lng = ~longitude, 
                   lat = ~latitude, 
                   color = ~pal(species),
                   radius = ~n*0.02,

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>What have I learned? Maps are much more challenging to work with than I thought they would be. I hit my three hour limit while trying to figure out how to use leaflet, but it was good practice. Next time I’ll try to add a legend so we know which color represents which species.</p>
<p>That’s all for now. As always you can find the code on my <a href="https://github.com/kputschko/kp-blogdown/tree/master/content/post">GitHub</a> page.</p>
