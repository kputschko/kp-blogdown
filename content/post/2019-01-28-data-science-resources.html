<p>I’ve been using R since 2013. In those days, R information was hard to come by. Information and best practices that did exist were kept under heavy guard. Most requests for help online were met with gate-keeping responses such as, “Did you read the help file?” or the classic, “Hey, I have a question”, followed by, “Never mind, I solved it - please delete”.</p>
<p>I’m glad that the data science community, and specifically the R and RStudio community have opened the gates, giving access to anyone who has a remote interest in data science. Data science is for all. So I’ve compiled a list of many resources that have helped me along the way.</p>
